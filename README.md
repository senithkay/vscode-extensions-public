## Installation

To install the dependencies for this repository, you can run the following command:

```bash
rush install
```

This command will install all the dependencies for all the workspaces in the mono-repo.

## Building the Mono-Repo

To build the entire mono-repo, you can run the following command:

```bash
rush build
```

This command will build all the packages in the mono-repo. The repository is configured to use a local build cache, so only the changed packages will be built.

### Building a Single Workspace

To build a single workspace in the mono-repo, you can run the following command:

```bash
rush build --to <package name>
```

Replace <package name> with the name of the package you want to build.

Example: To build ballerina-low-code-editor, you can run the following command:
```bash
rush build -o @wso2-enterprise/ballerina-visualizer
```
### Adding a New Package

To add a new package to the mono-repo:

First go to the root directory of the desired package.

```bash
cd ballerina/ballerina-visualizer
```

Execute the following command.

```bash
rush add --package <package-name> 
```

Replace <package-name> with the name of the package you want to add. If `-m` argument passed, other packages with this dependency will have their package.json files updated to use the same version of the dependency

## Other Important Commands

- `rush update`: This command updates the dependencies shrinkwrap file in the mono-repo.
- `rush rebuild`: This command cleans the common/temp folder and then runs rush build command.
- `rush check`: This command checks the consistency of the package dependencies, and ensures that all the packages are built with the same version of the dependencies.
- `rush purge`: This command cleans up the temporary files and folders in the mono-repo.
