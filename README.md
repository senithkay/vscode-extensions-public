## Developer Guide

### Requirements

- NodeJs : 16.x
- Setup [VSCode Ext Development Enviornment](https://github.com/wso2-enterprise/ballerina-plugin-vscode) : (For testing Ballerina Low Code Editor with VSCode)


### Local Development

First, you need to build the all the modules using ```npm run build``` command at repo root.
This will download all the dependencies and wireup inter dependencies using symlinks.

Depending on the module you want to develop, you can choose to open any individual module folder in your IDE or open the whole repository if you are planning to make changes across multiple modules.

You can run any command inside a single module by passing the ```--workspace``` argument to ```npm run <cmd>```. Or to run a command for all the modules, you can use ```--workspaces``` argument

some examples 
- To build statement editor ```npm run build --workspace=statement-editor```
- To run tests in all modules ```npm run test --workspaces```

Please check <package.json> - we have added some common cmds as scripts there to help you.

#### Changing and testing dependant modules

For example, statement-editor module is being used by low-code-editor module. Lets say, you want to change statement-editor and test low-code-editor with those changes included. You can follow below steps in this case.

- Make necessary changes in statement-editor and run ```npm run build:se```
- Then build low-code-editor by running ```npm run build:lce```

If you want keep changing while doing the changes

- Run ```npm run watch --workspace=statement-editor```
- Run ```npm run watch --workspace=low-code-editor```

#### IMPORTANT! Installing dependencies to workspaces

Always run the ```npm i``` command from repo root with relavant workspace args added at the end to indicate to which these should be installed.

eg: ```  npm i -D source-map-loader --workspace low-code-editor ```

If you do a npm i from workspace directory, it will create a new package-lock there and can create inconsistencies.
