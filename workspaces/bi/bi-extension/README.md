# Ballerina Integrator for Visual Studio Code (BI for VS Code) 

WSO2 Ballerina Integrator Visual Studio Code extension (BI for VSCode) is a comprehensive integration solution that simplifies your digital transformation journey. It streamlines connectivity among applications, services, data, and the cloud using a user-friendly low-code graphical designing experience and revolutionizes your integration development workflow. As an integration developer, you can execute all the development lifecycle phases using this tool. When your integration solutions are production-ready, you can easily push the artifacts to your continuous integration/continuous deployment pipeline.

## Prerequisites

You need the following to work with the BI for VS Code extension.

- Ballerina VS Code extension 5.0.0 or above
- Ballerina Swan Lake Update 12 or above

If these prerequisites are not installed on your local machine, the Ballerina Integrator for VS Code extension will guide you through the download and configuration process during the setup.

If a different Ballerina version is installed on your local machine, you'll be prompted to download the required versions.

## Get Started

1. Launch VS Code with the Ballerina Integrator for Visual Studio Code (BI for VS Code) extension installed. When the extension is installed properly, you can see the Ballerina Integrator icon in the Activity Bar of the VS Code editor.

2. Click on the Ballerina Integrator icon on the Activity Bar of the VS Code editor to open the extension and get started.

To get started, you need to first create the integration. You can either open a folder containing an integration or create a new integration. Alternatively, you can use an integration sample provided under Explore Samples, which will generate the required integrations and files for a specific use case.

## Ballerina Integrator Project Explorer

Ballerina Integrator (BI) Project Explorer provides a view of all the project directories created for your integration solution. Shown below is the project explorer of a sample project.

You can add the artifacts required for your integration using BI Project Explorer.

## WSO2 Copilot

The WSO2 Copilot is an AI-powered tool that simplifies the process of creating integration scenarios. It allows you to specify integration requirements using natural language or by providing relevant files, such as OpenAPI specifications. WSO2 Copilot generates the necessary integration artifacts, which can be seamlessly incorporated into your projects. You can iteratively refine your projects through conversational prompts, enabling the addition of features or modifications with ease. This approach supports incremental development, allowing you to build and enhance your integration projects over time.

You can create any integration project by entering your integration scenario in natural language into the provided text box, allowing AI to generate the necessary artifacts.

You can provide integration requirements as:

- Text prompts: Describe your integration scenario in natural language.
- Files: Upload relevant files, such as OpenAPI specifications, that provide additional context for the integration.
