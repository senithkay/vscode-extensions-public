## Features

The VS Code extension allows you to design and develop your Ballerina program using a graphical representation of the code. This graphical view displays the logic and network interaction of a function or a service resource, which makes it easy to understand the source. 

### Architecture View

The <a href="https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/design-the-application/" target="_blank">Architecture View</a> offers a high-level overview of Ballerina projects based solely on the source code to understand the components of the project and how they interact.
