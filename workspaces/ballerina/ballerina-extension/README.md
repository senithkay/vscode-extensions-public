# The Ballerina extension for Visual Studio Code

The Ballerina VS Code extension offers the ability to visualize the bidirectional mapping between the syntax and graphical representation of your <a href="https://ballerina.io/" target="_blank">Ballerina</a> source code. 

Apart from the visual programming features described below, the Ballerina VS Code extension enhances the Ballerina development experience by providing a comprehensive set of other features, including code editing, debugging, code execution, and code deployment. For detailed information on them, go to the <a href="https://ballerina.io/learn/vs-code-extension/" target="_blank">Ballerina VS Code extension documentation</a>.

## Quick start

## Features

The VS Code extension allows you to design and develop your Ballerina program using a graphical representation of the code. This graphical view displays the logic and network interaction of a function or a service resource, which makes it easy to understand the source. 

### Ballerina Visualizer View

The Ballerina Visualizer View offers a high-level overview of Ballerina projects based solely on the source code to understand the components of the project and how they interact.

### Service Designer View

The Ballerina VS Code extension enables the intuitive creation of Ballerina services (<a href="https://ballerina.io/learn/vs-code-extension/design-the-services/http-api-designer/" target="_blank">HTTP</a> and <a href="https://ballerina.io/learn/vs-code-extension/design-the-services/graphql-api-designer/" target="_blank">GraphQL</a>) without deep familiarity with syntax and configurations.
