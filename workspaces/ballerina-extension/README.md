# The Ballerina extension for Visual Studio Code

The Ballerina VS Code extension offers the ability to visualize the bidirectional mapping between the syntax and graphical representation of your [Ballerina](https://ballerina.io/) source code. 

## Quick start

Follow the steps below to get the Ballerina VS Code extension up and running.

1. [Install the extension](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/get-started/install-the-extension/).
2. [Run a program](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/get-started/run-a-program/).

## Features

The VS Code extension allows you to design and develop your Ballerina program using a graphical representation of the code. This graphical view displays the logic and network interaction of a function or a service resource, which makes it easy to understand the source. 

### Architecture View

The [Architecture View](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/visual-programming/architecture-view/architecture-diagram/) offers a high-level overview of Ballerina projects based solely on the source code to understand the components of the project and how they interact.

### Service designing

The Ballerina VS Code extension enables the intuitive creation of Ballerina services ([HTTP](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/visual-programming/http-api-designer/) and [GraphQL](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/visual-programming/graphql-designer/)) without deep familiarity with syntax and configurations.

### Sequence Diagram

The [Sequence Diagram](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/visual-programming/sequence-diagram-view/) provides a graphical user interface that allows users to visualize and construct program logic by capturing the flow, concurrency, endpoints, and interactions within the code.

### Data Mapper

The [visual data mapping feature](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/visual-programming/data-mapper/) facilitates effortless data mapping through an intuitive interface by simplifying complexity and enabling users to concentrate on business logic.
