# The Ballerina extension for Visual Studio Code

The Ballerina extension for Visual Studio Code provides a set of rich language features along with an enhanced user experience. 

It offers easy development, execution, debugging, and testing for the [Ballerina programming language](https://ballerina.io/). The Ballerina language possesses a bidirectional mapping between its syntaxes and the visual representation. 

The VS Code extension allows you to design and develop Ballerina programs graphically by visualizing them as graphical representations. The graphical view displays the logic and network interaction of a function or service resource that makes it easy to understand and implement it. 

> The [Ballerina VS Code Extension Documentation](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/) describes the visual programming features of this extension in detail.
