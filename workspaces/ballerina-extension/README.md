# The Ballerina extension for Visual Studio Code

The Ballerina extension for Visual Studio Code provides a set of rich language features along with an enhanced user experience. 

It offers easy development, execution, debugging, and testing capabilities for the [Ballerina programming language](https://ballerina.io/). The Ballerina language possesses a bidirectional mapping between its syntax and the visual representation. 

The VS Code extension allows you to design and develop Ballerina programs by visualizing them as graphical representations. The graphical view displays the logic and network interaction of a function or service resource, making it easy to understand and implement. 

> The [Ballerina VS Code extension documentation](https://wso2.com/ballerina/vscode/docs/) describes the features of this extension in detail.
